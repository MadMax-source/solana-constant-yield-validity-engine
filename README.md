# SOL Pointer Engine (Volatility-Based Trading System)

## What is this project?

This project is an automated trading system designed for **Solana (SOL)**.

The system does **not** try to predict the future price of SOL.  
It does **not** guess tops or bottoms.  
It does **not** rely on indicators or hype.

Instead, it is built around one simple idea:

> **Earn a small, fixed amount of SOL repeatedly by harvesting short-term price movement, while protecting capital during strong trends and crashes.**

The system is:

- SOL-denominated
- Volatility-first
- Risk-controlled
- Designed to survive bad markets, not chase good ones

---

## What problem does this solve?

Most trading systems fail because they:

- Assume the market will behave normally
- Break during long trends
- Overtrade during crashes
- Depend on prediction instead of structure

This system is built for the opposite reality:

- Markets trend
- Markets crash
- Volatility disappears and returns
- Liquidity conditions change

The goal is **survival first**, profit second.

## Core idea (in simple words)

The system watches how the price of SOL **moves**, not where it is.

It looks for:

- Small drops
- Small recoveries
- Repeated back-and-forth movement (“wiggles”)

Every time the market provides one of these wiggles:

- The system completes a trade
- A **fixed amount of SOL** is earned

When the market stops wiggling and starts trending:

- The system **locks**
- It stops taking risk
- It waits

When volatility returns:

- Locked trades are exited **together**
- Capital is recovered safely
- Trading resumes

## Key rules of the full system (non-negotiable)

### 1. Fixed profit per completed trade

Every completed trade earns **exactly**:
